# C Programs – Arrays, Strings, and Sorting

This repository contains basic C programs related to arrays, strings, and sorting.
These programs are written to help beginners understand fundamental concepts of
C programming and Data Structures.

## Programs Included

### Array Programs
- Insertion of an element in an array
- Deletion of an element from an array

### String Programs
- String reversal using character swapping

### Sorting Programs
- Bubble Sort (Ascending Order)

## Bubble Sort (Brief Description)
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.  
It works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements of the array and swapping them
if they are in the wrong order. After each pass, the largest element moves to its
correct position at the end of the array.

## Purpose of This Repository
- To practice basic array and string operations
- To understand simple sorting algorithms
- Helpful for students learning C programming and Data Structures
